This is the frontend code for the 4413 Ecommerce Project by Zuhair Siddiqi & Jason Nguyen

## Getting Started

First, ensure you have a recent version of node.js installed (18+)

Then install the modules that node.js will use using

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the server using

```bash

npm run dev
```

(You can also use yarn or pnpm, but we used npm)

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the website, this local version will not load without the backend running.
