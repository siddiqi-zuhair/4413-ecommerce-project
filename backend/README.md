This is the backend code for the 4413 Ecommerce Project by Zuhair Siddiqi & Jason Nguyen

## Getting Started

First, ensure you have a recent version of node.js installed (18+)

Then install the modules that node.js will use using

```bash
npm install
```


Then run the server using

```bash

npm start
```

(You can also use yarn or pnpm, but we used npm)

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) with your browser to see the server, you need to go to specific routes for it to show results.

Test cases which were made with jest can be ran using

```bash
npm test
```
